## Documentation

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/Clever/clever-go?status.png)](https://godoc.org/github.com/Clever/clever-go).

## Developing

clever-go is built and tested against Go 1.2.
Ensure this is the version of Go you're running with `go version`.
Make sure your GOPATH is set, e.g. `export GOPATH=~/go`.
Clone the repository to a location outside your GOPATH, and symlink it to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/Clever/clever-go`.
If you have done all of the above, then you should be able to run

```
make
```
